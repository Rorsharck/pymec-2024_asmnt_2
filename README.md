This small script, explores how to open files in abf format (Axon Binary File), using the neo package which enables hierarchical access to data inside the file. We extract the recordings of a eurydendroid cell in zebrafish, while the fish is moving in the dark, making spontaneous swims.

The code then extracts the features of the swim such as bout strength, duration etc and correlates it with EC cell activity to see if their role in zebrafish locomotion!
